    NOTE 2: if you are using POST with HTTPS, Django will require to send Referer, to avoid
        this problem you must add to the view of your url definition csrf_exempt(), as follows:

        Check: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11374382/how-can-i-disable-djangos-csrf-protection-only-in-certain-cases
        They recommend in this post to use the decorator, but we didn't manage to make it work
        in the post() method inside our class-view. Probably this will work in the dispatch().
